# ChocolateChip
üç™ Round 2 With the CHIP-8 Emulator

Almost finished, still has a few small bugs

# Some very useful resources:

# Improved Stuff in Rewrite;

* **SDL instead of SFML** I've found SDL to be much easier to use, plus it's much more widespread.
* **Much shorter and concise operations** All the usual operands are grabbed at the beginning, makes code _much_ shorter (most of the opcodes are one-liners), consistent, and less prone to error.

* **Fixed a bunch of bugs** These will be explained on later in the soon-to-be extensive README/Wiki
